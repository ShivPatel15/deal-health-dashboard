        "oppSummary": "Moda in Pelle is a $75,900 MCV new business opportunity ($1.04M total 3-year revenue) for a UK-based footwear and accessories retailer with 27 physical stores/concessions and a growing ecommerce presence. The company recently underwent an acquisition and leadership change, which has prompted a full review of their technology stack. They are migrating from Visualsoft (their current platform and implementation partner) to Shopify Plus with Shopify Payments, targeting a contract signature by end of February 2026 and a go-live in March/April 2026.",
        "whyChange": "Moda in Pelle has experienced significant brand and business damage over the past 12 months due to their current technology limitations. Matt Holden stated: 'I think the last 12 months have been tricky. I don't think we put our best foot forward. Probably damaged the brand more than we should have done.' The company's recent acquisition and change in leadership has triggered a comprehensive review of their technology infrastructure, with the new owners giving them 'a green light to pretty much do what we want from an ecom perspective.' Their current platform has left them stuck — Matt acknowledged that without action 'we'll be sat with the same site for the next 10 years.' The business needs a more capable ecommerce solution to drive online sales diversification.",
        "whyShopify": "Shopify is being evaluated as the platform that can modernize Moda in Pelle's ecommerce operations and unify their online and retail presence. The team has already invested significant effort in backend integration work — Matt confirmed 'we have internally actually already built the connection between our systems and Shopify.' Shopify Payments offers a competitive rate structure (1.1% domestic vs. their current blended 1.18%), and approximately £27,000 in incremental revenue estimated from Shop Pay's 23 million UK user base. Visualsoft, their current platform provider, is pivoting to become the Shopify implementation partner for the front-end build, which provides continuity while upgrading the underlying technology. POS is also a consideration for their 27 store locations, though bespoke functionality requirements exist.",
        "whyNow": "The acquisition and leadership change is the primary catalyst. The new owners have authorized the ecommerce team to modernize, and the board is actively reviewing P&L projections, team structures, and 3-5 year goals. There is a concrete timeline: contract signature targeted for end of February 2026, with a March/April 2026 go-live. Shopify's discounted pricing (0.8% retail transaction rate, promotional credits) has been held beyond the original December 2025 deadline, and internal credibility for maintaining these rates is eroding — creating commercial urgency to finalize the deal now.",
        "supportNeeded": "1) Maintain discounted pricing credibility — clear communication of a firm deadline may force signature action. 2) POS bespoke functionality assessment — Matt identified 'four or five things which in our world will be showstoppers' for full POS rollout. 3) SEO migration risk mitigation — Matt stated 'It's primarily the SEO stuff that we're worried about.' 4) Engage the actual decision maker (Anil Patel) — invited to ALL 3 calls, attended NONE. 5) Engage Finance Director (Chloe Sherwood) — ZERO engagement to date. 6) Commercial handoff clarity — Shiv Patel and Ben Homer being introduced as post-sale contacts."

The merchant targets a July 2026 launch to replatform their e-commerce site, with the ambition of growing online B2C penetration from 17-18% to 25% of total sales over 24 months. The deal is currently in Deal Craft stage at 80% probability with a Feb 27, 2026 close date, and the merchant has signaled readiness to sign in February — Fiona Scott (Head of eCommerce, now primary contact after Alice Bennett's maternity leave) sent a recent email indicating willingness to sign this quarter.",

B2C sales are 17-18% of total, targeting 25%. The original evaluation considered a phased approach but has since prioritized full migration by July 2026.",

Unified Plus offering with future POS potential. Merchant actively asked for Shopify's input on their agency partner shortlist, indicating trust. Digital wallets, subscriptions, and modern checkout on a supported, future-proof platform.",

Salesforce contract runs to 2027, so decision needed now. Fiona emailed team indicating readiness to sign in February. CEO Nathan Smith attended Jan 28 call — executive alignment signal.",

The deal is valued at $82,800 MCV with $4.27M in 3-year total revenue and is in Deal Craft stage at 80% probability. Martin Wareing (Head of IT) confirmed budget sign-off is imminent. The SFCC license expiring in February 2026 creates a hard compelling event, and SI partner Tryzens actively recommended Shopify.",
        "whyChange": "Dune is on Salesforce Commerce Cloud for eCommerce and Anakta for in-store POS, creating significant operational friction. All changes must go through Tryzens in monthly sprints — no in-house control. Martin described having to 'mold ways of working to the platform.' Anakta POS adds complexity around payment gateway management and reconciliation. TCO is high across both stacks, and with SFCC licensing expiring Feb 2026, they face an inflection point: renew an expensive, inflexible stack or migrate.",
        "whyShopify": "Unified eCom + POS on a single platform replacing two systems (SFCC + Anakta). Martin excited about in-house control rather than agency dependency. TCO comparison showed meaningful savings. 2-hour demo drew 'very complimentary' feedback. Integrated payments eliminate Anakta gateway complexity. Tryzens — their trusted SI partner — recommended Shopify. Martin asked 'What's the playbook?' showing confidence in Shopify's migration expertise. No competitors in evaluation.",
        "whyNow": "SFCC licensing expires February 2026 — a hard contractual deadline. Must either renew or migrate. High TCO makes status quo untenable. Martin targeted end-of-January for contract signature, and as of Feb 19, budget sign-off is 'any day now.' Proposed May 1, 2026 launch creates back-pressure on decision timeline.",

        "oppSummary": "Mulberry Company (Sales) Limited is a UK-based luxury fashion brand (~£161.5M revenue, ~1,000 employees) evaluating Shopify Plus as a replacement for their current custom-built SAP Hybris e-commerce platform, which goes end-of-support in January 2027. This is an $82,800 MCV new business deal with $841,500 in projected 3-year total revenue and $51M in D2C GMV. The deal is currently in the Demonstrate stage at 60% probability, forecasted as Commit but flagged as 'Committed - At Risk,' with a close date of February 28, 2026. Legal negotiations are active but contentious — Shopify has pushed back 3x on Mulberry's contract asks — and new peripheral queries around China and Markets have emerged, adding complexity. A second SI partner (Arsenalia) has just been engaged alongside Impact Commerce, suggesting implementation scoping is underway but potentially not yet settled.",
        "whyChange": "Mulberry's current e-commerce platform is built on SAP Hybris, which is going end-of-support in January 2027 — creating a hard deadline to migrate. They previously attempted to solve this by implementing Salesforce Commerce Cloud in 2024, but that project failed, meaning they've already burned time and budget on one migration attempt. Beyond the platform sunset, Mulberry's leadership has identified their legacy tech stack as a growth inhibitor — specifically, they have identified a new customer segment they want to pursue but cannot scale their business to address it on their current architecture. The business problem is therefore both defensive (platform going dark) and offensive (new growth opportunity blocked by tech limitations). The combination of a failed prior migration, an immovable platform sunset, and unmet growth ambitions creates significant organizational urgency and pain.",
        "whyShopify": "Shopify is being evaluated as a proven, lower-risk alternative after the failed Salesforce Commerce Cloud implementation. Mulberry is comparing Shopify Plus against Scayle and BigCommerce, with SFCC as the primary named competitor. The engagement of Shopify's Field CTO (Peyman Naeini) in an executive alignment call with Mulberry's CIO and CMO suggests Shopify is positioning on strategic credibility and enterprise readiness. The Adyen/Shopify meeting indicates payments integration is a key workstream. Shopify's D2C strength aligns well with Mulberry's $51M D2C GMV, and the Plus Product Suite positions Shopify as a comprehensive platform rather than a point solution.",
        "whyNow": "The primary timeline driver is the SAP Hybris end-of-support in January 2027, which gives Mulberry approximately 11 months from today to complete a full platform migration — an aggressive but achievable timeline if a decision is made in Q1 2026. The failed SFCC implementation in 2024 has already cost them at least a year, amplifying the urgency. If Mulberry doesn't commit soon, they risk running out of implementation runway before the Hybris sunset, potentially forcing a costly extended support arrangement or a rushed migration.",
        "supportNeeded": "1) Legal/Contract resolution — Mulberry's legal team has pushed back 3x on the Plus contract. Must resolve outstanding redlines quickly or escalate.\n2) China and Markets clarification — New queries around Shopify's capabilities for China and Shopify Markets need thorough, timely async responses.\n3) Arsenalia SI engagement — Discovery with second implementation partner just kicked off. Ensure clarity on SI strategy.\n4) CIO engagement deepening — Dharmini Chauhan has very limited engagement (11 emails, 1 reply). Need strategy to deepen access.\n5) Competitive differentiation vs. Scayle and BigCommerce — Ensure clear positioning, especially on enterprise/luxury brand fit.\n6) Final technical validation and RFP follow-ups — Close out promptly to maintain momentum."

        "oppSummary": "Wacoal Europe is a $285,200 MCV Plus deal ($1.24M 3yr total revenue) to migrate 4 lingerie brands (Wacoal, Fantasy, Freya, Elomi) from SAP Commerce to Shopify Plus with multi-brand, multi-market D2C storefronts and Shopify Payments. The deal is in Deal Craft at 80% probability with a Feb 28, 2026 close date, driven by CIO Danny Dawes, with VML as the implementation partner. The primary negotiation sticking points have been Shopify Payments transaction fees versus their current provider Comptop, preservation of a ~$46K credit, and financial settlement/reconciliation concerns — with Danny explicitly stating he would delay a year and renew with SAP if commercials can't be resolved.",
        "whyChange": "Wacoal Europe's current SAP Commerce platform contract expires in January 2027, creating a hard deadline for a platform decision. The organization has accumulated significant technical debt and operational friction with their existing stack — Danny's team previously attempted a migration with Alkai that failed and wasted ~$40K before being terminated over contractual disagreements around co-marketing discounts. The Black Friday 2025 results underscored challenges with their D2C/ecom channel — Danny noted that 'D2C/ecom was challenging' while brick-and-mortar performed well, suggesting their current platform isn't supporting digital commerce growth. The financial reconciliation and settlement processes on their current stack are causing acute anxiety — Samantha Hadland from the finance team said the settlement piece 'makes me feel sick', and Laura Simon called it 'enormous for us.'",
        "whyShopify": "Wacoal Europe evaluated Shopify through reference conversations with World of Books (a Shopify merchant) and Wacoal US (their parent company's US operation already on Shopify), both of which generated positive signals — Danny confirmed he was 'keen on the platform' after these conversations. The multi-brand, multi-market architecture on Shopify Plus (markets + expansion stores) was validated as technically viable for their 4-brand, 7-store setup at a predictable cost of $2,300/month per brand regardless of store count. Shopify's built-in security capabilities address infrastructure concerns. The platform's ability to support a phased approach — starting with 4 brands with potential to bring Bravissimo (60M+ net GMV) onto Shopify in future — represents significant expansion opportunity and strategic alignment.",
        "whyNow": "The SAP Commerce contract expires January 2027, requiring a November 2026 go-live at the latest to give proper notice. Danny confirmed this is a hard constraint — if they miss the window, they would 'stay with SAP for another year.' The board has already allocated budget (100K opex + 500K capex), and exceeding 500K total triggers Japan parent company board approval which Danny explicitly wants to avoid.

      "narrative": {
        "oppSummary": "Sofa.com (owned by Frasers Group) is evaluating a migration from SAP Commerce Cloud (Hybris) to Shopify Plus, representing $82,800 MCV and $1.22M in 3-year total revenue. The deal is currently stuck in the Demonstrate stage at 60% probability, with the primary blocker being Frasers Group's internal IT approval process — Tom Humphrey and Blayne Griffin-Reader have been waiting over two months just to secure an initial meeting with Group IT. VML (agency partner) has built a TCO/business case showing ~£600K savings over 3 years with a 12-month payback period, and a 3-year ROI comparison of Hybris vs Shopify is under review, but no decision can progress until Group IT confirms the current system's inadequacy.",
        "whyChange": "Sofa.com is running on SAP Commerce Cloud (Hybris), which sits within Frasers Group's archaic, centralized tech infrastructure. The platform creates significant operational pain: manual processes dominate day-to-day work, the team has limited internal tech/dev resources, and peak trading periods expose the system's inability to scale efficiently. The complex SKU structure (large volumes of product variations) is poorly served by the current setup. Payment processing through Elevon is causing unnecessary costs. Sofa.com is a 'small cog in a big wheel' at Frasers Group, and the centralized IT approach is holding back a brand that needs agility and modern commerce capabilities.",
        "whyShopify": "Shopify is being evaluated primarily because of its ability to dramatically reduce total cost of ownership and operational complexity. VML's TCO analysis projected ~£600K in savings over three years with a 12-month payback period. Shopify Payments is a significant differentiator with competitive rates vs Elevon and projected $71K annual Shop Pay revenue uplift. VML emphasized Shopify's fit for sofa.com's complex SKU structure, proposing Patchworks as the integration middleware. Critically, another Frasers Group brand — Everlast USA — is already on Shopify, establishing internal precedent.",
        "whyNow": "There is no hard compelling event — no contract renewal date, no system end-of-life, and no board mandate with a deadline. The urgency is soft: Tom and Blayne want to go live in H2 2026, which means they need IT approval within 1-2 months to stay on track for a 2-3 month build. The real driver is organizational frustration — every month of delay is a month of lost operational efficiency and potential revenue growth. Without a hard compelling event, this deal is at risk of indefinite delays within Frasers Group's slow bureaucratic approval process.",
        "supportNeeded": "1) Review and validate Tom's 3-year ROI calculation (Hybris vs Shopify). 2) Help build the case that migration cannot be done on existing Frasers infrastructure — leverage Everlast USA precedent. 3) Maissa to connect with VML (Sam/Scott) for continuity after AE handover. 4) Provide tangible payments rate comparison (Shopify vs Elevon). 5) Ben Homer to prepare exec POV doc for Frasers Group leadership. 6) Pre-stage contract details for legal review once IT approval is obtained."

      "narrative": {
        "oppSummary": "Essentiel Antwerp (Belgian fashion brand under Kadin Group) is evaluating a full-stack Shopify Plus migration encompassing D2C, POS Pro across ~50 retail stores, and Shopify Payments. The deal is valued at $82,800 MCV with $2.33M in projected 3-year revenue and significant GMV ($25.5M D2C, $39.4M Retail, $33.1M Payments GPV). The opportunity is at the Demonstrate stage with a 60% probability, but is flagged as Committed - At Risk due to dependencies on an internal ERP modernization decision and complex international entity structure. An RFP is now live with 7 agencies responding, and build is targeted to start in April 2026 with a September 2026 go-live.",
        "whyChange": "Essentiel Antwerp is carrying significant tech debt across their commerce stack. Their current Magento platform is approaching contract renewal at EOY 2026. Their ERP landscape is fragmented — wholesale has already migrated to ItsPerfect, but DTC and retail operations remain on an older Microsoft Business Central that requires expensive upgrades. The cost and complexity of upgrading Business Central is a major pain point. Filip noted the 'massive cost factor' of upgrading their current ERP stack, prompting evaluation of whether a platform consolidation to Shopify could reduce overall TCO and provide omnichannel capability they currently lack.",
        "whyShopify": "Shopify is positioned as the omnichannel consolidation play — replacing Magento for DTC while adding POS Pro across ~50 retail stores and unifying payments under Shopify Payments. The CFO was actively engaged evaluating financial details including Shop Pay's projected 5% revenue uplift and competitive processing rates. Filip confirmed management reception was positive and the revised payment offer was not a deal-breaker due to overall TCO savings. Centra is the only competitor listed, positioned unfavorably. The RFP with 7 agencies and April build target suggests strong forward momentum.",
        "whyNow": "Two converging compelling events: 1) Magento contract renewal due EOY 2026 creating a hard deadline; 2) Concurrent ERP modernization initiative where Business Central's future directly shapes Shopify integration architecture. The RFP has landed with 7 agencies and build is targeted for April 2026. Proposed launch September 30, 2026 for both Plus and Retail.",
        "supportNeeded": "1) Resolve ItsPerfect + Shopify Markets compatibility for US entity structure (critical path). 2) Support middleware/integration architecture for Business Central. 3) Provide technical guidance to 7 RFP agencies. 4) AE transition support — Ben Rees needs to establish relationship with CFO Koenraad. 5) Formalized TCO comparison for CFO/board. 6) POS Pro retail proof points for ~50 store deployment."

Now restarted by new CTO (Tom) targeting Christmas 2026 go-live. Current blocker is board-level pushback on payment processing rates, with a critical Feb 20 commercial director call to align on rates.",
        "whyChange": "Mint Velvet runs Sitoo POS across 110 stores while on Shopify Plus for D2C, creating a fragmented commerce stack. New CTO (Tom) joined with a mandate to modernize. 21+ POS sync calls in 2025 surfaced pain points around financial reconciliation, inventory management, omni-channel gaps, and operational overhead of separate systems. New sub-brand Arttov further compounds the need for a unified platform.",

POS capabilities extensively validated across 13 months of engagement. Patchworks middleware confirmed for Arttov sub-brand inventory sync. Shopify POS is the ONLY solution that natively unifies with their existing Shopify Plus D2C store.",
        "whyNow": "New CTO (Tom) joined specifically wanting to restart POS evaluation. Christmas 2026 go-live target across 110 stores means decision needed by Q1-Q2 2026. Arttov sub-brand launch needs integrated infrastructure. However, board pushback on rates threatens the timeline. Feb 20 commercial director call is the critical inflection point.",
        "supportNeeded": "1) Competitive payment rate negotiation — board pushback on rates is the #1 blocker. 2) Irish entity registration guidance for Shopify Payments POS. 3) Arttov sub-brand architecture and expansion store pricing clarity. 4) International omni-channel structure finalization. 5) Implementation timeline and partner readiness for 110-store rollout by Christmas 2026. 6) Klarna and payment method parity for Finance Director buy-in."

        "whyChange": "Oliver Bonas is running on Adobe Commerce (Magento) with a NetSuite ERP that is also being replaced. Ben Curtis, Director of Ecommerce, has explicitly stated they want to avoid 'putting lots of additional investment into Adobe especially with the new ERP system... only to then rip it all out again later,' indicating significant concern about throwing good money after bad. The current tech stack creates complexity around omnichannel capabilities like click & collect, endless aisle, and save-the-sale — features Ben noted 'can be mitigated without additional development if we were to go down a single vendor solution.' The simultaneous ERP replacement and Adobe contract expiry create a natural inflection point where re-platforming makes strategic sense.",
        "whyShopify": "Oliver Bonas is drawn to Shopify's unified commerce proposition — a single platform covering D2C, POS, and potentially B2B from one backend, which directly addresses their pain around operational complexity and multi-system integration. Stacey Flannery brings prior Shopify experience from a previous role, providing internal familiarity and implicit advocacy. The January demo successfully shifted Ben's perception of Shopify themes from 'restrictive' to a viable option. The POS demo to 7 retail operations attendees on Feb 11 received 'good feedback,' suggesting strong alignment with retail team needs. SEO capabilities also received positive validation from their SEO Manager Francesco.",
        "whyNow": "The Adobe Commerce contract expires October 2026, creating a hard decision deadline. Ben stated clearly in November 2025 that he wanted to 'by the end of this year understand exactly what we're doing' to avoid wasted investment in Adobe. The simultaneous NetSuite ERP replacement amplifies urgency. The RFP process has narrowed from 6 vendors to approximately 2, indicating the evaluation is in its final stages. However, the AE's compelling event note reveals that 'timings may not align' for the omnichannel/retail component, with Ben initially reviewing 'online only ahead of our Adobe renewal' — though the successful POS demo and Ben's comment about doing 'both things together' indicate this may be shifting.",
        "supportNeeded": "Implementation cost clarity is the #1 blocker — Ben explicitly called implementation costs their 'black hole' and noted competitors offer free or heavily discounted implementation. Shopify must help OB get precise scoping through partner introductions (Adriana has quoted £50-70k from agencies). TCO comparison needs collaborative completion. Partner agency introductions for formal scoping are the critical next step to advance from Demonstrate to Deal Craft. Continued validation of theme-based approach vs headless is needed, as competitors are positioned on custom approaches. RFP response / rate review statement needs to be completed promptly. Retail/POS business case may need a phased migration plan to reduce risk perception."

        "oppSummary": "Cycle King & Hawk is a UK multi-store cycling retailer (23 stores, expanding to 26) evaluating Shopify Plus for D2C e-commerce and eventually POS. The deal is valued at $82,800 MCV with $874K in 3-year total revenue and $2.6M in Payments GPV. The merchant's online business is significantly underperforming (£1.5M online vs £13.5M in-store, 0.3% conversion rate), and their current platform provider Citrus Lime is limiting growth through poor functionality, lack of customization, and high costs (~£250K/year). The deal is in Demonstrate stage with a close date of March 27, 2026, and the merchant's current e-commerce contract expires in April 2026, creating a hard deadline.",
        "whyChange": "Cycle King's current e-commerce and EPOS provider, Citrus Lime, is fundamentally limiting their online growth. Their online conversion rate sits at just 0.3%, and online revenue (£1.5M) represents only ~10% of their total retail revenue (£13.5M in-store), suggesting massive untapped digital potential. Darren Hunt has explicitly stated that the current solution 'is impeding online growth' due to poor functionality, lack of customization, and limited ability to create a customer-centric experience. Key operational pain points include poor integration between website and EPOS, difficulties handling cycle-to-work vouchers, and limited click-and-collect and workshop/servicing capabilities. The cost of Citrus Lime at ~£250K/year is high relative to value delivered, and the business is rapidly scaling (23 stores growing to 26).",
        "whyShopify": "Darren has expressed clear interest in Shopify's ability to provide a more customizable, integrated, and scalable solution compared to Citrus Lime. Shopify's growing experience with cycling businesses was highlighted during initial discovery, and its ability to handle live inventory updates across multiple stores is directly relevant to Cycle King's omnichannel needs. The phased migration approach (website first, POS later in 2027) aligns with Shopify's flexibility. However, Shopify has not yet been formally selected — Darren is evaluating but appears 'keen to transition to Shopify.' No competing vendors were explicitly mentioned.",
        "whyNow": "The primary urgency driver is the expiration of Cycle King's current e-commerce contract with Citrus Lime in April 2026, creating a hard deadline. Additionally, Cycle King is in active growth mode (expanding from 23 to 26 stores), and the 0.3% online conversion rate represents a significant revenue gap. Darren's frustration with the current platform has reached a tipping point, with limitations now actively impeding business growth.",

        "oppSummary": "Direct Wines Limited is a $4.58M new business opportunity ($13.76M 3-year revenue, $7.94M IPP) to migrate their global wine e-commerce operation (15-17 brands across UK, US, AU/NZ, $162M D2C GMV, $8M Retail GMV, $210.6M Payments GPV) from a legacy ATG/commercetools tech stack to Shopify Enterprise with Payments, POS, and Recharge subscriptions. The deal is in Demonstrate stage at 60% probability with a March 31, 2026 close date, a board sign-off meeting targeted for March 24, and Fusefabric (SI partner) discovery wrapping up mid-February. Commercetools is the primary competitor, but Shopify holds a strong position bolstered by BrewDog references and Recharge alignment, though payment rate competitiveness and Enterprise vs Plus pricing remain key commercial hurdles.",
        "whyChange": "Direct Wines is trapped in a legacy technology stack that is actively harming their business. Their ATG platform is approaching end-of-life for support, and their migration to commercetools has been slow, expensive, and fraught with integration challenges. Nicole Romito stated: 'We are not on the right tech stack for customer expectations in our market,' and 'Right now, if we want to migrate to a new customer service tool, it's a two-year project of a custom build.' The company is spending over $6M/year on outsourced development, their Contentful CMS is described as expensive and restrictive, and custom builds take 8-12 months. The new global CEO has challenged UK leadership to become 'customer obsessed,' but the current D2C experience is below the required level. Subscriptions represent approximately 50-60% of revenue, making subscription commerce capability a non-negotiable requirement.",
        "whyShopify": "Direct Wines sees Shopify as a path to dramatically reduce tech complexity and cost while improving customer experience and time-to-market. Andy Brooks (Director of Ecommerce) was highly impressed by the platform demo: 'I think it's incredible. I think it's an amazing product.' The US team (Nicole Romito, Elyse Barton) is extremely pro-Shopify. Key advantages include: consolidated tech stack replacing ATG/commercetools/Contentful, dramatically faster store builds ($75K-$180K vs 8-12 month custom builds), variabilized technology costs vs heavy capex, Shopify Audiences for customer acquisition (CEO's #1 concern), Shop Pay conversion uplift and fraud tools, and a proven migration path with Recharge for their critical 50-60% subscription business.",
        "whyNow": "Multiple converging urgency drivers: ATG support reaching end-of-life, new CEO mandate for customer obsession, D2C experience below required standard, $6M+/year ongoing development costs creating continuous financial pressure, and board sign-off meeting targeted for March 24, 2026. Fusefabric's SI discovery is wrapping up the week of February 17. Martyn Oakley (CIO): 'If the rates are going to blow our heads off and we can take cost out and sell more wine, we will go fast.'",
        "supportNeeded": "1) Competitive payment rate modeling - Tim Curtis identified a 'sizeable gap' between current UK rates and Shopify's proposed rates. Need DW's unredacted December UK payment statement. 2) Enterprise vs Plus pricing clarity - Neil Rhodes indicated Plus being cheaper might 'push them over the edge.' 3) Token migration confidence across 15-17 brands and multiple PSPs. 4) Board-ready business case / complete TCO comparison. 5) Fusefabric discovery alignment and implementation timeline confidence. 6) Peer references and case studies (BrewDog)."

The deal is at 80% probability in Deal Craft stage, with CEO Touker Suleyman pushing aggressively to sign and go live by August 2026 ahead of peak trading season. Agency selection (implementation partner) is the final gating item before contract signature.",
        "whyChange": "Hawes & Curtis is running on a legacy custom-built platform that is actively preventing the business from growing and innovating. Their current tech stack cannot deliver the customer experiences they need to drive online growth, with technical limitations surfacing around inventory management, order statuses, and the inability to unify D2C and POS without heavy integration work. The CTO's team raised multiple concerns about their current platform's rigidity during the technical workshop. The business has aggressive growth targets and the CEO is personally driving urgency, demanding project completion in four to five months with no delays.",
        "whyShopify": "Other brands within the Hawes & Curtis group are already on Shopify, which means the team has existing Shopify expertise and organizational confidence in the platform. The technical workshop demonstrated strong platform foundations, developer tools, pre-built integrations, and Shopify Markets for consolidating multiple stores. The payments discussion highlighted Shopify's integrated payment solution with superior authorization rates and end-to-end fraud management compared to Adyen. The unified D2C and POS platform eliminates integration friction.",
        "whyNow": "The primary driver is an August 2026 go-live target ahead of the peak trading season — missing this window would mean another year on the underperforming legacy platform during their most critical revenue period. CEO Touker Suleyman is personally mandating the timeline, stating: 'I want the whole project done in four months... four to five months. So by mid-June latest.' The aggressive growth targets make delay commercially unacceptable.",

Payments competitive positioning vs. Adyen with additional data. Fraud management confidence building for retail team.

      "narrative": {
        "oppSummary": "Bugaboo International B.V. is evaluating Shopify Plus for a multi-brand D2C migration starting with Artipoppe, with the intent to subsequently migrate Joolz and potentially Bugaboo itself. The deal is valued at $82,800 (Plus Standard) with $51M D2C GMV and a 3-year revenue impact of $841,500. The group is currently on Salesforce Commerce Cloud and is undergoing significant organizational restructuring — including acquisitions (Joolz), leadership changes, and a new co-CEO (Richard) — while simultaneously selecting a migration agency and negotiating an MSA structure with Shopify.",
        "whyChange": "Bugaboo Group is consolidating multiple brands (Bugaboo, Artipoppe, Joolz) under a single umbrella following acquisitions, and needs a unified, scalable commerce platform to support this multi-brand strategy. The current Joolz agency (Wolfpack) is being terminated, indicating dissatisfaction with existing vendor relationships. Artipoppe is migrating to NetSuite on the ERP side, suggesting broader digital transformation. There is an implicit Salesforce Commerce Cloud contract end date driving the evaluation, with Jordan explicitly stating 'when this Salesforce contract ends' there's no reason they wouldn't migrate. Organizational changes (new co-CEO Richard, new Artipoppe GM) create a decision window where leadership wants to future-proof the tech stack.",
        "whyShopify": "The entire agency evaluation (Code, Flatline, AskPhill, Wolfpack) is centered around Shopify implementation, indicating Shopify Plus has already been selected as the target platform — the decision is about which agency will implement it, not whether to use Shopify. Jordan's champion behavior is evident: he is actively managing the agency selection process and coordinating with Ben Rees on contract structure. Ben has proactively proposed an MSA structure that allows multi-brand onboarding under a single legal framework. The agencies being evaluated are all dedicated Shopify agencies, reinforcing that the platform decision has effectively been made. External consultant Metis also recommended Shopify in their report.",
        "whyNow": "The SFCC contract has a defined end date creating a natural decision point. Organizational restructuring — new co-CEO Richard in place, new Artipoppe GM hired, Joolz acquisition integration underway — means leadership is actively making infrastructure decisions now. Jordan indicated a realistic Q2 start with agency pitches expected to conclude by end of January. Ben suggested negotiating the Shopify contract within Q1 could be advantageous even if the project starts in Q2.",
        "supportNeeded": "1) MSA/Legal framework preparation — Jordan agreed to MSA approach; Shopify legal needs to begin drafting. 2) Agency selection support — continued guidance on agency capabilities for the NetSuite integration. 3) NetSuite integration expertise — flagged as 'the most challenging bit' due to low internal IT capacity. 4) Engagement with Richard (co-CEO) — he can sign off the deal but Shopify hasn't engaged directly with him yet. 5) NRF in-person engagement — Jordan attending; opportunity to deepen relationship. 6) Q1 contract negotiation timing — late Jan/early Feb target for commercial terms discussion."

      "narrative": {
        "oppSummary": "C.P. Hart & Sons Limited is a luxury bathroom retailer (~90 years old) evaluating Shopify Plus to replace their outdated, custom-built e-commerce platform. The deal is valued at $82,800/year ($2.18M over 3 years) with $40M D2C GMV, $26M Payments GPV, and a projected billed revenue of ~$759K. Mo Goodfellow (Director, Marketing & Digital) is leading the evaluation after his senior e-commerce manager (Diamante) went on personal leave, and he needs to present a costed replatforming proposal to the board in mid-February, with budgets signed off by end of June for a new financial year starting August 1.",
        "whyChange": "C.P. Hart's current e-commerce platform is a custom-built, legacy system described as 'quite custom made, quite old' and 'split in two,' where every small change requires going through a dev agency with no clarity on timelines. The website is the primary lead generation engine for their showroom business (90-95% of sales), yet the current platform fails to represent their luxury brand adequately online and lacks best-practice UI/UX, templated design capabilities, and proper customer journey tracking. Mo emphasized the existential business case: 'we're 90 years old next year. If we want to last for another 90 years we need to start at the beginning of the funnel again.' Significant organizational change — their MD was promoted out and the parent company has a new CEO — adds pressure to demonstrate digital modernization.",
        "whyShopify": "C.P. Hart is drawn to Shopify Plus for its templated best practices, built-in UI/UX capabilities, and the ability to represent their luxury brand beautifully without requiring an in-house expert designer. Shopify's integrated approach to online and in-store operations appeals to their hybrid business model (50% end consumer, 50% trade/contracts), and the platform's flexibility, faster development cycles, and clear timelines stand in direct contrast to their current agency dependency. Shopify Payments at potentially advantageous rates was noted as a factor. No other competitors were explicitly mentioned, suggesting Shopify may be the primary alternative being evaluated.",
        "whyNow": "The primary urgency driver is a board meeting in mid-February where Mo must present a costed replatforming proposal. Budgets for the new financial year (starting August 1) are signed off by end of June — if not approved this cycle, the project slips an entire year. Additional urgency from organizational shake-up (MD promoted out, new parent company CEO) creates both risk and opportunity. Diamante's unexpected personal leave has compressed the evaluation timeline.",
        "supportNeeded": "Business case / TCO calculation for board presentation; case studies of similar luxury retailers on Shopify Plus; agency recommendations for implementation partner; NDA in Word format (process prerequisite); payments clarity around third-party fee implications; extra technical hand-holding while Diamante is on leave; timeline confidence for August launch."
