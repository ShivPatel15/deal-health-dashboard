        "oppSummary": "Moda in Pelle is a $75,900 MCV new business opportunity ($1.04M total 3-year revenue) for a UK-based footwear and accessories retailer with 27 physical stores/concessions and a growing ecommerce presence. The company recently underwent an acquisition and leadership change, which has prompted a full review of their technology stack. They are migrating from Visualsoft (their current platform and implementation partner) to Shopify Plus with Shopify Payments, targeting a contract signature by end of February 2026 and a go-live in March/April 2026.",
        "whyChange": "Moda in Pelle has experienced significant brand and business damage over the past 12 months due to their current technology limitations. Matt Holden stated: 'I think the last 12 months have been tricky. I don't think we put our best foot forward. Probably damaged the brand more than we should have done.' The company's recent acquisition and change in leadership has triggered a comprehensive review of their technology infrastructure, with the new owners giving them 'a green light to pretty much do what we want from an ecom perspective.' Their current platform has left them stuck \u2014 Matt acknowledged that without action 'we'll be sat with the same site for the next 10 years.' The business needs a more capable ecommerce solution to drive online sales diversification.",
        "whyShopify": "Shopify is being evaluated as the platform that can modernize Moda in Pelle's ecommerce operations and unify their online and retail presence. The team has already invested significant effort in backend integration work \u2014 Matt confirmed 'we have internally actually already built the connection between our systems and Shopify.' Shopify Payments offers a competitive rate structure (1.1% domestic vs. their current blended 1.18%), and approximately \u00a327,000 in incremental revenue estimated from Shop Pay's 23 million UK user base. Visualsoft, their current platform provider, is pivoting to become the Shopify implementation partner for the front-end build, which provides continuity while upgrading the underlying technology. POS is also a consideration for their 27 store locations, though bespoke functionality requirements exist.",
        "whyNow": "The acquisition and leadership change is the primary catalyst. The new owners have authorized the ecommerce team to modernize, and the board is actively reviewing P&L projections, team structures, and 3-5 year goals. There is a concrete timeline: contract signature targeted for end of February 2026, with a March/April 2026 go-live. Shopify's discounted pricing (0.8% retail transaction rate, promotional credits) has been held beyond the original December 2025 deadline, and internal credibility for maintaining these rates is eroding \u2014 creating commercial urgency to finalize the deal now.",
        "supportNeeded": "1) Maintain discounted pricing credibility \u2014 clear communication of a firm deadline may force signature action. 2) POS bespoke functionality assessment \u2014 Matt identified 'four or five things which in our world will be showstoppers' for full POS rollout. 3) SEO migration risk mitigation \u2014 Matt stated 'It's primarily the SEO stuff that we're worried about.' 4) Engage the actual decision maker (Anil Patel) \u2014 invited to ALL 3 calls, attended NONE. 5) Engage Finance Director (Chloe Sherwood) \u2014 ZERO engagement to date. 6) Commercial handoff clarity \u2014 Shiv Patel and Ben Homer being introduced as post-sale contacts."

        "whyShopify": "Whittard seeks improved customer experience, enhanced technology stack flexibility, and the ability to overcome Site Genesis limitations \u2014 all areas where Shopify Plus excels. The deal originated as a Partner Referral, with trusted agencies (Tryzens, Vervaunt) recommending Shopify. Inclusion of Shopify Payments indicates interest in consolidating payments stack. The team has been preparing UK heritage brand reference stories, mobile conversion wins, and subscription use cases. Whittard is engaging multiple agencies (shortlist of 4) with SFCC migration experience.",
