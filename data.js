        "oppSummary": "Moda in Pelle is a $75,900 MCV new business opportunity ($1.04M total 3-year revenue) for a UK-based footwear and accessories retailer with 27 physical stores/concessions and a growing ecommerce presence. The company recently underwent an acquisition and leadership change, which has prompted a full review of their technology stack. They are migrating from Visualsoft (their current platform and implementation partner) to Shopify Plus with Shopify Payments, targeting a contract signature by end of February 2026 and a go-live in March/April 2026.",
        "whyChange": "Moda in Pelle has experienced significant brand and business damage over the past 12 months due to their current technology limitations. Matt Holden stated: 'I think the last 12 months have been tricky. I don't think we put our best foot forward. Probably damaged the brand more than we should have done.' The company's recent acquisition and change in leadership has triggered a comprehensive review of their technology infrastructure, with the new owners giving them 'a green light to pretty much do what we want from an ecom perspective.' Their current platform has left them stuck — Matt acknowledged that without action 'we'll be sat with the same site for the next 10 years.' The business needs a more capable ecommerce solution to drive online sales diversification.",
        "whyShopify": "Shopify is being evaluated as the platform that can modernize Moda in Pelle's ecommerce operations and unify their online and retail presence. The team has already invested significant effort in backend integration work — Matt confirmed 'we have internally actually already built the connection between our systems and Shopify.' Shopify Payments offers a competitive rate structure (1.1% domestic vs. their current blended 1.18%), and approximately £27,000 in incremental revenue estimated from Shop Pay's 23 million UK user base. Visualsoft, their current platform provider, is pivoting to become the Shopify implementation partner for the front-end build, which provides continuity while upgrading the underlying technology. POS is also a consideration for their 27 store locations, though bespoke functionality requirements exist.",
        "whyNow": "The acquisition and leadership change is the primary catalyst. The new owners have authorized the ecommerce team to modernize, and the board is actively reviewing P&L projections, team structures, and 3-5 year goals. There is a concrete timeline: contract signature targeted for end of February 2026, with a March/April 2026 go-live. Shopify's discounted pricing (0.8% retail transaction rate, promotional credits) has been held beyond the original December 2025 deadline, and internal credibility for maintaining these rates is eroding — creating commercial urgency to finalize the deal now.",
        "supportNeeded": "1) Maintain discounted pricing credibility — clear communication of a firm deadline may force signature action. 2) POS bespoke functionality assessment — Matt identified 'four or five things which in our world will be showstoppers' for full POS rollout. 3) SEO migration risk mitigation — Matt stated 'It's primarily the SEO stuff that we're worried about.' 4) Engage the actual decision maker (Anil Patel) — invited to ALL 3 calls, attended NONE. 5) Engage Finance Director (Chloe Sherwood) — ZERO engagement to date. 6) Commercial handoff clarity — Shiv Patel and Ben Homer being introduced as post-sale contacts."

This is a heritage UK retail brand looking to migrate off Salesforce Commerce Cloud (Site Genesis) to Shopify, driven by high development costs, poor mobile performance, and platform inflexibility. The deal is in Deal Craft stage at 80% probability with a close date of February 27, 2026 — just 9 days away — and the merchant has signaled intent to sign in February.",
        "whyChange": "Whittard is facing significant challenges with their current Salesforce Commerce Cloud (Site Genesis) implementation: high development costs to maintain and evolve the platform, integration complexities that slow down their ability to connect systems, and inadequate mobile performance — critical for a D2C retailer. They are on Site Genesis (older, legacy SFCC architecture) facing a 'modernize or migrate' decision, and the cost/complexity of upgrading within the Salesforce ecosystem has tipped the scales toward evaluating alternatives. Leadership (CEO and Head of eCommerce) are engaged, indicating this is a strategic priority.",
        "whyShopify": "Whittard seeks improved customer experience, enhanced technology stack flexibility, and the ability to overcome Site Genesis limitations — all areas where Shopify Plus excels. The deal originated as a Partner Referral, with trusted agencies (Tryzens, Vervaunt) recommending Shopify. Inclusion of Shopify Payments indicates interest in consolidating payments stack. The team has been preparing UK heritage brand reference stories, mobile conversion wins, and subscription use cases. Whittard is engaging multiple agencies (shortlist of 4) with SFCC migration experience.",
        "whyNow": "Fiona Scott (Head of eCommerce) directly communicated intent to sign in February 2026. The proposed launch date of July 1, 2026 creates back-pressure — any delay compresses the migration window. CEO-level engagement, active agency selection, and strategic urgency to move off aging Site Genesis all point to a 'now or never' dynamic for this budget cycle.",
        "supportNeeded": "1. Complete payment statement collection — parts of Worldpay statement still missing, prerequisite for Shopify Payments terms, could delay contract given 9-day window\n2. Merchant Validation Form confirmation — unclear if returned\n3. CEO (Nathan Smith) engagement call — Fiona mentioned scheduling follow-up, could be final sign-off\n4. UK heritage brand references — deploy 2-3 reference stories proactively\n5. Agency/partner guidance — provide input on which of the 4 shortlisted agencies have best SFCC migration experience\n6. Technical support for Vervaunt discovery — actively follow up to prevent technical blockers"

        "oppSummary": "Dune Group – D2C-Retail: $82,800 MCV deal with $4.27M total 3-year revenue (heavily weighted toward Retail Payments at $3.38M). UK-based fashion retailer with 55+ stores and a growing web channel (~$50M online, ~$97M retail), migrating from Salesforce Commerce Cloud + Anakta POS to Shopify Plus + POS Pro. The deal is in Deal Craft at 80% probability with a Feb 27, 2026 target close, but a critical payments pricing blocker emerged: Shopify Payments costs ~£430K more annually than their existing Worldpay arrangement, which directly contradicts Dune's expectation that Shopify would reduce total cost of ownership.",
        "whyChange": "Dune's current tech stack — Salesforce Commerce Cloud for web and Anakta (Anacar) POS for retail — carries a combined annual cost of approximately $1M USD ($650K SFCC + $350K Anakta), which the business views as excessively high relative to the value delivered. The Salesforce licensing is expiring and the high TCO is a documented compelling event. Their SI partner Tryzens recommended Shopify as an alternative, suggesting the market has moved beyond SFCC for their needs. Additionally, the current POS system has contract break clauses in June and September 2026, creating a natural window to exit. Andy Grainger (who holds final decision authority) explicitly stated concern about operational risk with the web channel — 'growth is 10 points this year...I can't afford risk' — indicating the current platform may be constraining their ability to capitalize on online momentum. The desire for a unified omnichannel experience (replacing disconnected POS and web systems) is a key driver, with Cheryl Lee from Retail Ops flagging that any non-integrated payment solution 'feels like going backwards from a customer experience point of view.'",
        "whyShopify": "Shopify was recommended by Dune's SI partner Tryzens, lending third-party credibility to the evaluation. The proposed Shopify platform fees (~$180K/yr) represent a dramatic reduction from the ~$1M current stack, and Shopify's team projected a 5–15% conversion uplift on the web channel which, on $50M+ in online revenue, would represent significant incremental growth. The unified POS + web platform on a single stack is a core draw — Dune wants to eliminate the fragmented experience of separate retail and ecommerce systems. Shopify's POS-first migration approach aligns well with Dune's phased strategy (POS in 2026, web in 2027), allowing them to prove value in-store before tackling the higher-risk web migration. However, enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by the payments pricing gap — the team assumed Shopify Payments would be cheaper than third-party processing, and the discovery that it's ~£430K more expensive annually was described by Andy as 'a bit of an issue.'",
        "whyNow": "The primary timeline drivers are contractual: Anakta POS contract breaks fall in June and September 2026, and budgets run February to February, making February/March 2026 the natural kickoff window for a POS migration targeting summer 2026 completion. Salesforce Commerce Cloud was recently renewed for two years (expiring ~early 2027), which defers the web migration decision but creates a hard deadline to have the full platform strategy decided before that renewal lapses. The combination of expiring licensing, high TCO, and the CEO (Nigel Darwin) being the contract signatory suggests board-level awareness and pressure to rationalize technology spend. If Dune misses the June/September POS contract breaks, they face another cycle locked into Anakta with no improvement to the in-store experience.",
        "supportNeeded": "1) Resolve the Shopify Payments pricing blocker: The ~£430K annual gap vs. Worldpay is the single biggest risk. Dune needs either significantly improved Shopify Payments rates, a viable integrated Worldpay pathway for POS, or a creative commercial structure that offsets the payments cost delta. 2) Hardware demo and logistics confirmation (scheduled Feb 19): Product team confirmed compatibility but Dune needs confidence hardware can be deployed across 55+ stores by summer 2026. Ethernet terminals being set aside due to stock constraints. 3) TCO flexibility / commercial creativity: Max committed to investigating TCO flexibility. Dune needs a clear apples-to-apples cost comparison. 4) Revenue impact model quantifying the 5-15% conversion uplift for board justification. 5) Phased migration confidence: References or case studies of successful POS-first migrations for similar UK retailers."

        "oppSummary": "Mulberry Company (Sales) Limited is a UK-based luxury fashion brand (~£161.5M revenue, ~1,000 employees) evaluating Shopify Plus as a replacement for their current custom-built SAP Hybris e-commerce platform, which goes end-of-support in January 2027. This is an $82,800 MCV new business deal with $841,500 in projected 3-year total revenue and $51M in D2C GMV. The deal is currently in the Demonstrate stage at 60% probability, forecasted as Commit but flagged as 'Committed - At Risk,' with a close date of February 28, 2026. Legal negotiations are active but contentious — Shopify has pushed back 3x on Mulberry's contract asks — and new peripheral queries around China and Markets have emerged, adding complexity. A second SI partner (Arsenalia) has just been engaged alongside Impact Commerce, suggesting implementation scoping is underway but potentially not yet settled.",
        "whyChange": "Mulberry's current e-commerce platform is built on SAP Hybris, which is going end-of-support in January 2027 — creating a hard deadline to migrate. They previously attempted to solve this by implementing Salesforce Commerce Cloud in 2024, but that project failed, meaning they've already burned time and budget on one migration attempt. Beyond the platform sunset, Mulberry's leadership has identified their legacy tech stack as a growth inhibitor — specifically, they have identified a new customer segment they want to pursue but cannot scale their business to address it on their current architecture. The business problem is therefore both defensive (platform going dark) and offensive (new growth opportunity blocked by tech limitations). The combination of a failed prior migration, an immovable platform sunset, and unmet growth ambitions creates significant organizational urgency and pain.",
        "whyShopify": "Shopify is being evaluated as a proven, lower-risk alternative after the failed Salesforce Commerce Cloud implementation. Mulberry is comparing Shopify Plus against Scayle and BigCommerce, with SFCC as the primary named competitor. The engagement of Shopify's Field CTO (Peyman Naeini) in an executive alignment call with Mulberry's CIO and CMO suggests Shopify is positioning on strategic credibility and enterprise readiness. The Adyen/Shopify meeting indicates payments integration is a key workstream. Shopify's D2C strength aligns well with Mulberry's $51M D2C GMV, and the Plus Product Suite positions Shopify as a comprehensive platform rather than a point solution.",
        "whyNow": "The primary timeline driver is the SAP Hybris end-of-support in January 2027, which gives Mulberry approximately 11 months from today to complete a full platform migration — an aggressive but achievable timeline if a decision is made in Q1 2026. The failed SFCC implementation in 2024 has already cost them at least a year, amplifying the urgency. If Mulberry doesn't commit soon, they risk running out of implementation runway before the Hybris sunset, potentially forcing a costly extended support arrangement or a rushed migration.",
        "supportNeeded": "1) Legal/Contract resolution — Mulberry's legal team has pushed back 3x on the Plus contract. Must resolve outstanding redlines quickly or escalate.\n2) China and Markets clarification — New queries around Shopify's capabilities for China and Shopify Markets need thorough, timely async responses.\n3) Arsenalia SI engagement — Discovery with second implementation partner just kicked off. Ensure clarity on SI strategy.\n4) CIO engagement deepening — Dharmini Chauhan has very limited engagement (11 emails, 1 reply). Need strategy to deepen access.\n5) Competitive differentiation vs. Scayle and BigCommerce — Ensure clear positioning, especially on enterprise/luxury brand fit.\n6) Final technical validation and RFP follow-ups — Close out promptly to maintain momentum."

        "oppSummary": "Wacoal Europe is a UK-based lingerie/intimates company evaluating Shopify Plus to replace its aging SAP Hybris platform across four brands (Freya, Fantasie, Elomi, Goddess). The deal is valued at $285,200 MCV ($1.24M total 3-year revenue) with £20M (~$29M) in D2C GMV and $18.85M in Payments GPV. The opportunity involves consolidating 16 separate SAP websites into 4 Shopify Plus stores using Markets for international expansion. A fifth brand, Bravissimo (£30M online, 25 retail stores), is excluded from Phase 1 but represents significant Phase 2 upside. The deal is commercially contingent on VML (SI partner) delivering a fixed-price implementation estimate within Danny Dawes’ £400K total budget constraint, which must also cover middleware to decouple from legacy ERP. Decision expected by Feb 27, offer expires March 13.",
        "whyChange": "Wacoal Europe’s SAP Hybris contract expires in January 2027, creating a hard platform end-of-life deadline. They are currently managing 16 separate SAP Hybris websites across four brands and multiple markets — an operationally complex and costly architecture that is unsustainable. Multiple technical blockers related to SAP (product hierarchy limitations, 2048 variant cap, multi-brand architecture challenges) were identified during discovery. The need to build a middleware layer to decouple from legacy ERP indicates deep technical debt. The consolidation from 16 sites to 4 stores represents a desire to dramatically simplify operations, reduce TCO, and modernize their digital commerce infrastructure.",
        "whyShopify": "Shopify Plus was selected after technical discovery confirmed it could address all identified SAP Hybris blockers — including product hierarchy requirements, the 2048 variant limitation, and multi-brand architecture. Shopify Markets enables consolidation of 16 separate country/brand websites into 4 brand-level stores with built-in international selling. VML (formerly Wunderman Thompson), a well-known Shopify Plus agency, referred this deal and is the implementation partner, suggesting confidence in the Shopify ecosystem. The SE confirmed ‘no technical blockers’ remain. Shopify Payments is included with $18.85M projected GPV.",
        "whyNow": "The SAP Hybris contract expires January 2027, creating an immovable deadline. Working backward, Wacoal must go live on Shopify by November 2026 (proposed launch date), meaning build needs to start as early as possible in 2026. The Shopify offer expires March 13, 2026, adding commercial urgency. Any further delay compresses the implementation timeline and puts the November 2026 go-live at risk, which would leave Wacoal without a platform when SAP expires.",
        "supportNeeded": "1) VML fixed-price estimate within budget — Danny will not sign without it. The £400K total budget must cover middleware + Shopify build. If VML comes in high, creative commercial solutions may be needed.\n2) Budget gap resolution — If VML estimate + middleware exceeds £400K, explore extended free months, phased billing, or reduced rates.\n3) Contract/legal review acceleration — Draft contract sent for legal review. Must resolve by Feb 27 decision date.\n4) Implementation timeline confidence — Reinforce feasibility of Nov 2026 go-live through references or case studies.\n5) Phase 2 (Bravissimo) vision building — Seed the conversation about £30M online + 25 stores on Shopify POS.\n6) Stakeholder mapping — Danny is the ONLY contact. Must identify broader buying committee, C-suite, and decision-makers."
