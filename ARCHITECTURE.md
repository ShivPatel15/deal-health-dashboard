# Deal Health Dashboard — Architecture & Data Safety

## Last Updated: 2026-02-20

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES (read first)

### 1. Single Directory Architecture
Everything lives in `/home/swarm/deal-health-app/`. There is ONE directory. Not two, not three. ONE.

```
/home/swarm/deal-health-app/       ← THE ONLY DIRECTORY
  ├── .git/                        ← Git repo (pushes to GitHub)
  ├── data/
  │   ├── opportunities.json       ← 🔴 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all opportunities
  │   ├── incoming-payload.json    ← Temporary: payload from orchestrator (overwritten each run)
  │   ├── version-history.json     ← Score change tracking
  │   └── sharing.json             ← Per-opp access control
  ├── data.js                      ← Built output served by the site (generated, never edit manually)
  ├── quick-deploy/data.js         ← Copy of data.js (generated, never edit manually)
  ├── index.html                   ← Dashboard UI
  ├── ingest-deal.js               ← Merges ONE payload into opportunities.json
  ├── build-data.js                ← Builds data.js from opportunities.json
  ├── publish.sh                   ← One-command pipeline: ingest → build → git push
  ├── coaching-engine.js           ← Generates coaching snapshots during build
  ├── score-rules.json             ← Scoring/health thresholds
  └── *.md                         ← Documentation
```

### 2. Source of Truth
`data/opportunities.json` is the **ONLY** source of truth. Everything else is derived from it:
- `data.js` = built from `opportunities.json` by `build-data.js`
- `quick-deploy/data.js` = copy of `data.js`
- The live site reads `data.js`

**Never** edit `data.js` directly. Always modify `opportunities.json` (via ingest-deal.js or manually) then rebuild.

### 3. Ingest MERGES, Never Overwrites
`ingest-deal.js` reads the EXISTING `data/opportunities.json`, finds the matching opportunity by ID, and updates ONLY that one record. All other opportunities are preserved.

**If `data/opportunities.json` does not exist or is empty, ingest will create a NEW file with ONLY the ingested opportunity. This is the primary cause of data loss.**

### 4. No Duplicate Directories
Previous bugs were caused by having 3 separate directories (`deal-health-app/`, `deal-health-site/`, `deal-health-dashboard/`) that drifted apart. These have been deleted. If they reappear, delete them immediately:
```bash
rm -rf /home/swarm/deal-health-site /home/swarm/deal-health-dashboard
```

## Data Flow

```
                  Orchestrator writes payload
                           │
                           ▼
              data/incoming-payload.json
                           │
                    ingest-deal.js
                    (MERGES into existing)
                           │
                           ▼
              data/opportunities.json     ← SOURCE OF TRUTH (12+ opps)
                           │
                     build-data.js
                     (reads opps, computes scores,
                      generates MAP, coaching)
                           │
                    ┌──────┴──────┐
                    ▼              ▼
               data.js    quick-deploy/data.js
                    │
              git add + commit + push
                    │
                    ▼
              GitHub repo
                    │
              User clones + quick deploy
                    │
                    ▼

```

## Pipeline Commands

### Full pipeline (ingest + build + push):
```bash
cd /home/swarm/deal-health-app
bash publish.sh "Update deal health: Account Name - 2026-02-20"
```

### Skip ingest (just rebuild and push):
```bash
bash publish.sh --skip-ingest "Rebuild and push"
```

### Manual steps (if publish.sh fails):
```bash
cd /home/swarm/deal-health-app

# 1. Ingest payload
node ingest-deal.js --input data/incoming-payload.json

# 2. Build data.js (writes BOTH root and quick-deploy/)
node build-data.js

# 3. Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "Update deal health"
git push origin main
```

---

## Safety Checks

### publish.sh includes:
1. **Refuses to run** if `data/opportunities.json` doesn't exist
2. **Warns** if fewer than 2 opportunities in the data store
3. **Verifies** built data.js has the same opportunity count as the source

### Before ANY ingest or publish, verify:
```bash
cd /home/swarm/deal-health-app
python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('data/opportunities.json')); print(f'{len(d)} opps')"
```
Expected: 12+ opportunities. If you see 0 or 1, STOP and restore from git history.

### Emergency restore:
```bash
cd /home/swarm/deal-health-app
# Find last good commit
git log --oneline -20
# Restore opportunities.json from a known good commit
git show <COMMIT>:data/opportunities.json > data/opportunities.json
# Or extract from data.js if opportunities.json wasn't committed:
python3 -c "
import json
with open('data.js') as f: c = f.read()
d = json.loads(c[c.index('{'):c.rindex('};')+1])
json.dump(d['opportunities'], open('data/opportunities.json','w'), indent=2)
print(f'Restored {len(d[\"opportunities\"])} opps')
"
# Then rebuild
node build-data.js
```

## Payload Schema for ingest-deal.js

}
```

### Key rules for the payload:
- `salesforce.opportunity_id` (or `opportunityId`) is the **merge key** — ingest finds the existing opp by this ID
- MEDDPICC questions can be either:
  - An **array** matched by index (preferred): `"questions": [{"answer": "Yes", ...}, ...]`
  - An **object** with keys `Q1`/`q1`, `Q2`/`q2`, etc.: `"questions": {"q1": {"score": "Yes", ...}, ...}`
  - Both `answer` and `score` fields are accepted for the Yes/No/Partial value
- Each section must have the exact number of questions (metrics: 7, EB: 6, DP: 7, DC: 7, PP: 7, IP: 8, CH: 7, CO: 5)
- `answer`/`score` must be exactly `"Yes"`, `"No"`, or `"Partial"` (case-sensitive)
- Narratives: accepted under `meddpicc_analysis.narrative` OR `meddpicc_analysis.narratives`
- MEDDPICC sections: accepted under `meddpicc_analysis.meddpicc` OR `meddpicc_analysis.sections`
- `projectedBilledRevenue`: accepted at `salesforce.projected_billed_revenue`, `salesforce.projectedBilledRevenue`, OR nested inside `salesforce.revenue.projected_billed_revenue`
- Revenue display: The dashboard shows **PBR (Projection of Billed Revenue)** as the primary revenue metric, NOT MCV

## Common Failures and Fixes

### "All my opportunities disappeared!"
**Cause:** `data/opportunities.json` was missing or contained only the new opp when ingest ran.
**Fix:** Restore from git history (see Emergency Restore above), then re-run ingest.

### "Score shows 0/54"
**Cause:** Payload used wrong nesting (e.g., `meddpicc_analysis.sections` instead of `meddpicc_analysis.meddpicc`).
**Fix:** Correct the payload nesting and re-ingest.

### "data.js has old scores but opportunities.json is correct"
**Cause:** `build-data.js` wasn't run after ingest, or wrote only to quick-deploy/.
**Fix:** Run `node build-data.js` — it now writes to BOTH root and quick-deploy/.

### "GitHub has different data than local"
**Cause:** Multiple directories pushing to same repo, or force-push from wrong state.
**Fix:** Verify local state, then `git push origin main --force` from the correct directory.
