    "summary": "Direct Wines Limited is a $4.58M ACV new business opportunity ($13.76M 3-year total revenue) involving a full D2C platform migration plus Shopify Payments across their multi-brand, multi-regional wine subscription and retail business (~$162M D2C GMV, $210.6M Payments GPV). The deal is in Demonstrate stage at 60% probability with a 2026-03-31 close date, but faces active competition from commercetools, unresolved Enterprise vs Plus pricing decisions, significant payments rate gap concerns, and a critical board sign-off meeting on 24/03. The engagement has shifted from an initial US-based champion (Neil Sumner) to a UK leadership team (COO Neil Rhodes, Group CIO Martyn Oakley, MD Matt Knight), introducing new dynamics and requiring re-establishment of champion relationships.",
    "narratives": {
      "why_change": "Direct Wines is running on an aging Oracle ATG platform approaching end-of-life for support, creating operational risk and dev bottlenecks. Current tech stack (including Contentful) causes pain: slow speed to market, high dev costs (~$8M annual), lack of agility, and difficulty managing 12+ brands across 16+ websites. New CEO has challenged UK leadership to become customer obsessed, explicitly calling out D2C experience as below required level. Business needs to double sales due to supply chain restructuring — potential 50% revenue growth target that current platform cannot support.",
      "why_shopify": "Shopify evaluated for ability to dramatically reduce dev costs (50-90% reduction cited), consolidate fragmented tech stack, and accelerate time-to-market. Key differentiators: Shop Pay conversion advantages, Shopify Audiences, checkout extensibility, integrated Recharge subscription capability (critical for subscription-heavy wine business). Competitive position strong with Brewdog + Recharge references. However, concerns persist about revenue share pricing, payments rate gap (Tim Curtis flagged 'sizeable gap' in UK rates), and 0.35% variable platform fee challenged.",
      "why_now": "Primary drivers: new CEO mandate for digital transformation, ATG support EOL, Fuse Fabric completing discovery week of 2026-02-18, board sign-off meeting scheduled 24/03. Combined with need to double sales capacity and active board decision cycle. Close date of 2026-03-31 is extremely tight given Enterprise vs Plus decision unresolved and payments commercials remain contentious.",
      "support_needed": "1) Enterprise vs Plus comparison document (blocking commercial finalization, #1 immediate gap). 2) Payments rate competitiveness — Tim Curtis flagged 'sizeable gap' in UK rates + T+3 settlement impact. 3) Token migration clarity including Scheme Reference Data (SRD) for UK subscriptions. 4) Brand definition and multi-region pricing model resolution. 5) Peer references (Brewdog) for 24/03 board meeting. 6) Fuse Fabric alignment to ensure their recommendation supports Shopify. 7) Reframing value narrative for tech team (avoid dev cost displacement messaging that alienates CIO)."
