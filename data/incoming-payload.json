      "opp_summary": "Moss Bros. Group Ltd is a £160M UK retailer evaluating Shopify Plus ($82,800 deal, $2.1M 3-year revenue impact) to replace their aging e-commerce platform (Remarkable) and legacy POS system (Dolphin). The evaluation is board-driven, with strategic directives to simplify a complex composable architecture, enable international expansion, and leverage AI — with a champion (Chris Turberville-Tully) actively building the case for a C-suite presentation targeted for early March 2026. This is a significantly more active deal than Salesforce data alone suggests, with 5 substantive discovery and technical calls completed since January 2026 and a tailored demo scheduled for the week of February 23rd.",
      "why_change": "Moss Bros. is running on two aging core systems — Remarkable for e-commerce and Dolphin for POS — both of which are failing to keep pace with the business. Remarkable is described as 'slow to adapt,' and the Dolphin POS system is aging to the point that replacing it is a top CEO/CFO priority. The company has invested heavily in a composable architecture (Zitec as middleware/CDP, OneStock for inventory), which has created significant complexity they want to simplify — they explicitly stated a need to 'uncomplicate their world.' Past security incidents have made the board acutely risk-averse and are now actively motivating a platform change. Operationally, their 'hire' business (suit rental with group bookings and deposits) and 'custom-made' business (bespoke tailoring/outfit builder) are fragmented across online and POS channels, creating inefficiency. The board and main shareholder are strategically questioning the current tech stack and have directed this evaluation.",
      "why_shopify": "Moss Bros. is drawn to Shopify for its unified commerce capabilities — the ability to consolidate e-commerce and POS onto a single platform, which directly addresses their core pain of managing disparate, aging systems. Chris Turberville-Tully is a self-described 'Shopify advocate' and is championing the platform to the CEO based on its simplicity, native integrations, and ability to reduce architectural complexity. The team expressed strong interest in Shopify's AI capabilities as a differentiator. They see Shopify as a way to consolidate disparate customer management systems and streamline their complex custom-made/outfit builder process across channels. International expansion support is also part of the strategic rationale, and Shopify Payments is being evaluated to replace Adyen as part of a broader simplification effort.",
      "why_now": "The evaluation is being driven by strategic board directives — the CEO and main shareholder are actively questioning the current technology stack and have mandated this review. The aging POS system (Dolphin) is a particularly urgent concern for the CEO and CFO, compounded by past security incidents that have heightened the board's appetite for change despite their risk-averse nature. There is a clear timeline forming: a technical demo review is scheduled for the week of February 23rd, with a C-suite presentation (CEO/CFO) targeted for early March 2026. While no hard contractual deadline has been mentioned, the board-level mandate and executive engagement suggest organizational momentum that could stall if not maintained.",
      "support_needed": "Handle complex 'hire' and 'custom-made' business model requirements — these are deal-critical (The Black Tux referenced as comparable). Address payment complexity and Adyen-to-Shopify Payments transition (split payments, deposits). Resolve average/weighted inventory costing question (raised multiple times). Provide implementation partner introductions (Chris requested 2-3 partners). Deliver case studies of similar UK retail migrations. Support Chris in overcoming Head of E-commerce resistance with an airtight business case. Provide realistic implementation timeline (flagged as critical by Joe). Clarify Zitec/OneStock integration approach — position around their existing investment, not against it."
