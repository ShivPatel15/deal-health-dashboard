      "opp_summary": "Bugaboo International B.V. is evaluating Shopify Plus for a multi-brand D2C migration starting with Artipoppe, with the intent to subsequently migrate Joolz and potentially Bugaboo itself. The deal is valued at $82,800 (Plus Standard) with $51M D2C GMV and a 3-year revenue impact of $841,500. The group is currently on Salesforce Commerce Cloud and is undergoing significant organizational restructuring — including acquisitions (Joolz), leadership changes, and a new co-CEO (Richard) — while simultaneously selecting a migration agency and negotiating an MSA structure with Shopify.",
      "why_change": "Bugaboo Group is consolidating multiple brands (Bugaboo, Artipoppe, Joolz) under a single umbrella following acquisitions, and needs a unified, scalable commerce platform to support this multi-brand strategy. The current Joolz agency (Wolfpack) is being terminated, indicating dissatisfaction with existing vendor relationships. Artipoppe is migrating to NetSuite on the ERP side, suggesting broader digital transformation. There is an implicit Salesforce Commerce Cloud contract end date driving the evaluation, with Jordan explicitly stating 'when this Salesforce contract ends' there's no reason they wouldn't migrate. Organizational changes (new co-CEO Richard, new Artipoppe GM) create a decision window where leadership wants to future-proof the tech stack.",
      "why_shopify": "The entire agency evaluation (Code, Flatline, AskPhill, Wolfpack) is centered around Shopify implementation, indicating Shopify Plus has already been selected as the target platform — the decision is about which agency will implement it, not whether to use Shopify. Jordan's champion behavior is evident: he is actively managing the agency selection process and coordinating with Ben Rees on contract structure. Ben has proactively proposed an MSA structure that allows multi-brand onboarding under a single legal framework. The agencies being evaluated are all dedicated Shopify agencies, reinforcing that the platform decision has effectively been made. External consultant Metis also recommended Shopify in their report.",
      "why_now": "The SFCC contract has a defined end date creating a natural decision point. Organizational restructuring — new co-CEO Richard in place, new Artipoppe GM hired, Joolz acquisition integration underway — means leadership is actively making infrastructure decisions now. Jordan indicated a realistic Q2 start with agency pitches expected to conclude by end of January. Ben suggested negotiating the Shopify contract within Q1 could be advantageous even if the project starts in Q2.",
      "support_needed": "1) MSA/Legal framework preparation — Jordan agreed to MSA approach; Shopify legal needs to begin drafting. 2) Agency selection support — continued guidance on agency capabilities for the NetSuite integration. 3) NetSuite integration expertise — flagged as 'the most challenging bit' due to low internal IT capacity. 4) Engagement with Richard (co-CEO) — he can sign off the deal but Shopify hasn't engaged directly with him yet. 5) NRF in-person engagement — Jordan attending; opportunity to deepen relationship. 6) Q1 contract negotiation timing — late Jan/early Feb target for commercial terms discussion."
