    "narrative": {
      "oppSummary": "Direct Wines Limited is a $4.58M new business opportunity ($13.76M 3-year revenue, $7.94M IPP) to migrate their global wine e-commerce operation (15-17 brands across UK, US, AU/NZ, $162M D2C GMV, $8M Retail GMV, $210.6M Payments GPV) from a legacy ATG/commercetools tech stack to Shopify Enterprise with Payments, POS, and Recharge subscriptions. The deal is in Demonstrate stage at 60% probability with a March 31, 2026 close date, a board sign-off meeting targeted for March 24, and Fusefabric (SI partner) discovery wrapping up mid-February. Commercetools is the primary competitor, but Shopify holds a strong position bolstered by BrewDog references and Recharge alignment, though payment rate competitiveness and Enterprise vs Plus pricing remain key commercial hurdles.",
      "whyChange": "Direct Wines is trapped in a legacy technology stack that is actively harming their business. Their ATG platform is approaching end-of-life for support, and their migration to commercetools has been slow, expensive, and fraught with integration challenges. Nicole Romito stated: 'We are not on the right tech stack for customer expectations in our market,' and 'Right now, if we want to migrate to a new customer service tool, it's a two-year project of a custom build.' The company is spending over $6M/year on outsourced development, their Contentful CMS is described as expensive and restrictive, and custom builds take 8-12 months. The new global CEO has challenged UK leadership to become 'customer obsessed,' but the current D2C experience is below the required level. Subscriptions represent approximately 50-60% of revenue, making subscription commerce capability a non-negotiable requirement.",
      "whyShopify": "Direct Wines sees Shopify as a path to dramatically reduce tech complexity and cost while improving customer experience and time-to-market. Andy Brooks (Director of Ecommerce) was highly impressed by the platform demo: 'I think it's incredible. I think it's an amazing product.' The US team (Nicole Romito, Elyse Barton) is extremely pro-Shopify. Key advantages include: consolidated tech stack replacing ATG/commercetools/Contentful, dramatically faster store builds ($75K-$180K vs 8-12 month custom builds), variabilized technology costs vs heavy capex, Shopify Audiences for customer acquisition (CEO's #1 concern), Shop Pay conversion uplift and fraud tools, and a proven migration path with Recharge for their critical 50-60% subscription business.",
      "whyNow": "Multiple converging urgency drivers: ATG support reaching end-of-life, new CEO mandate for customer obsession, D2C experience below required standard, $6M+/year ongoing development costs creating continuous financial pressure, and board sign-off meeting targeted for March 24, 2026. Fusefabric's SI discovery is wrapping up the week of February 17. Martyn Oakley (CIO): 'If the rates are going to blow our heads off and we can take cost out and sell more wine, we will go fast.'",
      "supportNeeded": "1) Competitive payment rate modeling - Tim Curtis identified a 'sizeable gap' between current UK rates and Shopify's proposed rates. Need DW's unredacted December UK payment statement. 2) Enterprise vs Plus pricing clarity - Neil Rhodes indicated Plus being cheaper might 'push them over the edge.' 3) Token migration confidence across 15-17 brands and multiple PSPs. 4) Board-ready business case / complete TCO comparison. 5) Fusefabric discovery alignment and implementation timeline confidence. 6) Peer references and case studies (BrewDog)."
