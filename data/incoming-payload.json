      "opp_summary": "Moss Bros. Group Ltd is a new business opportunity in the Envision stage with an annual deal value of $82,800 and a 3-year total revenue impact of $2,129,400. The deal involves D2C Standard Plus with Shopify Payments attached ($25.35M GPV against $39M D2C GMV). The opportunity was created on January 16, 2026, with a projected close date of September 30, 2026, currently at 20% probability with merchant intent listed as Uncommitted.",
      "why_change": "Not discussed in available calls. No call transcripts are available, and the Salesforce data does not include a compelling event or specific pain points driving the evaluation. The AE next steps reference a \"technical discovery\" session and an introduction to a deal champion (Chris Turberville-Tulley), suggesting early-stage qualification is still underway. Without transcripts or documented business pain, the reasons for evaluating a platform change remain unknown at this time.",
      "why_shopify": "Not discussed in available calls. The Salesforce data confirms Moss Bros. is evaluating Shopify Plus with D2C Standard and Shopify Payments, but no competitive context, feature-specific interest, or comparison notes are documented. No competitor field is populated, and position vs. competitor is blank. A demo was booked for February 25, 2026, which may begin to surface why Shopify is being considered, but no evidence exists yet.",
      "why_now": "Not discussed in available calls. No compelling event is documented in Salesforce. The close date of September 30, 2026, suggests a roughly 8-month sales cycle was projected at opportunity creation, but there is no indication of what external business event, contract renewal, or internal pressure is driving the timeline. This is a critical gap that needs to be addressed in upcoming discovery sessions.",
      "support_needed": "Complete technical discovery to understand Moss Bros.' current tech stack, pain points, and migration requirements. Introduction to and engagement with the identified deal champion, Chris Turberville-Tulley. Demo delivery (booked for February 25, 2026) tailored to Moss Bros.' D2C and payments use cases. Identification and documentation of compelling event and urgency drivers. Competitive landscape assessment — no competitors currently identified."
