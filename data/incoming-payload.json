      "oppSummary": "Trinny London is an $82,800 Plus deal (D2C Standard) with $76M projected D2C GMV, $49.4M Payments GPV, and a 3-year total revenue of $3.31M. The London-based beauty brand is evaluating a migration from Commerce Tools (their current headless commerce platform) to Shopify Plus, driven by contract renewal timing, operational inefficiencies, tech debt, and a desire for faster development and reduced total cost of ownership. The deal is currently in Solution stage at 40% probability with a June 30, 2026 close target, and the merchant is actively deep in technical validation \u2014 having conducted 14 calls including detailed architecture demos, tax/store structure discussions, and business case presentations.",
      "whyChange": "Trinny London's current Commerce Tools headless architecture is creating significant operational friction and cost burden. The team explicitly stated they are exploring alternatives due to their Commerce Tools renewal, citing the need for increased efficiencies, enhanced internationalization (Germany), and better tech support. Their headless setup has created challenges with bundling and customization \u2014 core to their 'match to me' personalized product experience. They've been considering moving back to Shopify for nearly a year (since April 2025), with concerns about headless limitations around app compatibility, tax handling, discount codes, and gift cards. Faye Roth stressed the importance of swift decision to avoid stagnation, suggesting internal frustration with the pace of progress on their current stack.",
      "whyShopify": "Shopify is positioned as a unified commerce platform that reduces complexity and lowers TCO compared to Commerce Tools' composable/headless approach. The headed (integrated) theme approach enables significantly faster migration (3-6 months vs longer headless rebuilds), with a hybrid option for initial launch speed. Business case highlights conversion uplift, TCO reduction, and improved CX as key differentiators. The Feb 5 demo showcased native capabilities around promotions, product management, dynamic price lists for multi-market differentiation, and flexible product variants/metafields. Shopify Payments ($49.4M GPV) is a significant value driver with competitive rates and revenue impact simulations offered. The merchant is evaluating D2C first before multi-channel POS, aligning with Shopify's platform expansion model.",
      "whyNow": "The urgency has sharpened considerably since the Feb 13 call. James Parker stated explicitly that 'every day we don't have a decision is costly to the project delivery' and indicated the team was hoping for 'a final decision in the next one to two weeks' \u2014 targeting ~Feb 27. It is now Feb 24 and merchant intent remains 'Uncommitted,' suggesting the decision is either imminent or has slipped. The unresolved tax architecture question (single store vs. dual store) is the critical blocker: Claire Curran flagged that the lack of automated US tax filing in a single-store model is 'edging toward a red flag.' The Commerce Tools renewal remains the macro compelling event, but the micro-urgency is now project delivery cost accumulating daily. Stephen Brook's paternity leave from Feb 18 created a handover gap to Ben Homer/Ben Rees.",
      "supportNeeded": "Key support areas: (1) Tax architecture recommendation with clear trade-off analysis \u2014 Claire Curran and James Parker need a definitive recommendation, not three options; (2) Regional discount/promotion workaround validation \u2014 discount codes not market-specific natively, need proven workaround with merchant reference; (3) Recommended app stack for cost modeling; (4) Seamless SE handover continuity \u2014 Ben Homer/Rees must be fully briefed on tax decision context, discount limitation, and HCL alignment; (5) Merchant references for brands that migrated from headless/composable to Shopify Plus (CEO-level request, still outstanding); (6) Dual-store Netsuite integration clarity."
