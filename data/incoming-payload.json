      "opp_summary": "Vision Healthcare is a buy-and-build portfolio company operating ~16 brands across fragmented tech stacks (Magento, CommerceTools, WordPress, and some Shopify). This $82,800 deal involves consolidating 4 brands (Vita Yummy, New Pure, N2, Alpha Foods) onto Shopify Plus under a 3-year multi-brand agreement at $8,280/month. The broader strategic play is to prove out Shopify with the N2 brand as a proof-of-concept, and if successful, migrate the remaining portfolio — covering ~95% of shared functionality — creating significant expansion potential well beyond the initial deal size.",
      "why_change": "Vision Healthcare's current tech stack is highly fragmented across Magento, CommerceTools, WordPress, and existing (improperly licensed) Shopify stores, creating operational inefficiency and technical debt. They have 4 full-time developers dedicated to Magento maintenance for 5+ years, representing a significant ongoing cost. Their earlier Shopify test with Tummy Talks resulted in a meaningful AOV drop due to an unoptimized checkout — particularly around Cash on Delivery features — which demonstrated the gap between their heavily customized Magento checkout and a vanilla Shopify experience. They are also dealing with an existing Shopify Plus contract breach (multiple brands on one license), which creates compliance risk. The COO (Iztok Hvala) has signaled that if the N2 proof-of-concept can match Magento's performance, it opens the door for full portfolio consolidation — suggesting the current multi-platform approach is unsustainable.",
      "why_shopify": "Vision Healthcare sees Shopify Plus as the consolidation platform for their multi-brand portfolio, attracted by the MSA/multi-brand agreement structure that provides preferential group pricing and simplified licensing. During the technical deep-dive, Ben Homer demonstrated that Shopify's Checkout Blocks, Flow, Search & Discovery, payment customization functions, and checkout UI extensions could replicate most of their critical Magento checkout features (subscription popups, cross-sells, COD greylisting, address validation). Iztok explicitly stated they don't need a 'copy paste' — they 'just want to have the same result' — indicating openness to Shopify's approach as long as business outcomes are preserved. They also have a recently acquired brand (Vayami) already on Shopify, giving them some platform familiarity. The potential to move to Shopify Payments and reduce the 0.2% external gateway fee (currently on Adyen at ~$180K/month group processing volume) is an additional financial incentive.",
      "why_now": "The most concrete timeline driver is the proposed contract signature deadline of February 13th, which was set partly because AE Yasmine Fazeli is going on maternity leave. Iztok accepted mid-February as feasible. The N2 brand POC is targeting a Q2 (April) launch in Spain, which creates a natural implementation timeline. However, there is no documented compelling event such as a Magento contract expiration, and the Salesforce 'Compelling Event' field is null. The urgency appears driven more by commercial offer timing and internal portfolio rationalization than by an external forcing function.",
      "support_needed": "Payment method feasibility and rate comparison (merchant sent Adyen invoices, needs confirmation on Shopify Payments support and fee comparison). COD checkout replication confidence for Spain, Italy, and Eastern Europe. Address validation solution for Italian and Spanish markets. Entity and billing structure clarification for multi-brand agreement. Technical architecture follow-up and POC support (COD payment customization and checkout subscription toggle feasibility). Smooth AE transition from Yasmine Fazeli to Maissa Fatte."
