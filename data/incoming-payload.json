      "opp_summary": "Trinny London is an $82,800 Plus deal (D2C Standard) with $76M projected D2C GMV, $49.4M Payments GPV, and a 3-year total revenue of $3.31M. The London-based beauty brand is evaluating a migration from Commerce Tools (their current headless commerce platform) to Shopify Plus, driven by contract renewal timing, operational inefficiencies, tech debt, and a desire for faster development and reduced total cost of ownership. The deal is currently in Solution stage at 40% probability with a June 30, 2026 close target, and the merchant is actively deep in technical validation — having conducted 14 calls including detailed architecture demos, tax/store structure discussions, and business case presentations.",
      "why_change": "Trinny London's current Commerce Tools headless architecture is creating significant operational friction and cost burden. The team explicitly stated they are exploring alternatives due to their Commerce Tools renewal, citing the need for increased efficiencies, enhanced internationalization (Germany), and better tech support. Their headless setup has created challenges with bundling and customization — core to their 'match to me' personalized product experience. They've been considering moving back to Shopify for nearly a year (since April 2025), with concerns about headless limitations around app compatibility, tax handling, discount codes, and gift cards. Faye Roth stressed the importance of swift decision to avoid stagnation, suggesting internal frustration with the pace of progress on their current stack.",
      "why_shopify": "Shopify is positioned as a unified commerce platform that reduces complexity and lowers TCO compared to Commerce Tools' composable/headless approach. The headed (integrated) theme approach enables significantly faster migration (3-6 months vs longer headless rebuilds), with a hybrid option for initial launch speed. Business case highlights conversion uplift, TCO reduction, and improved CX as key differentiators. The Feb 5 demo showcased native capabilities around promotions, product management, dynamic price lists for multi-market differentiation, and flexible product variants/metafields. Shopify Payments ($49.4M GPV) is a significant value driver with competitive rates and revenue impact simulations offered. The merchant is evaluating D2C first before multi-channel POS, aligning with Shopify's platform expansion model.",
      "why_now": "The Commerce Tools contract renewal is the primary compelling event. Internal urgency is evident: a board-level go/no-go decision was referenced in the Feb 4 check-in, Faye Roth emphasized avoiding stagnation, and the team is targeting a full launch by early next FY. The combination of contract renewal pressure, board-level attention, and nearly a year of evaluation (since April 2025) suggests the merchant is approaching a decision point, though the 'Uncommitted' merchant intent flag indicates they haven't fully committed to migrating yet.",
      "support_needed": "Key support areas: (1) Merchant references for brands that migrated from headless/composable to Shopify Plus; (2) Adyen vs Shopify Payments conversion rate comparison and POS hardware pricing for 19 terminals; (3) Tax and store architecture clarity — single vs dual store for US tax filing automation, Avalara integration, Shopify Tax capabilities; (4) HCL partner enablement — they have limited Shopify experience; (5) Advanced bundling and VIP price list solutions for their 'match to me' personalized products; (6) Rate review / commercial optimization for TCO argument; (7) Continuity during Stephen Brook's paternity leave (Feb 18 – Mar 17) — Ben Homer covering as SE."
