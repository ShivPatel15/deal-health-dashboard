      "opp_summary": "C.P. Hart & Sons Limited is a luxury bathroom retailer (~90 years old) evaluating Shopify Plus to replace their outdated, custom-built e-commerce platform. The deal is valued at $82,800/year ($2.18M over 3 years) with $40M D2C GMV, $26M Payments GPV, and a projected billed revenue of ~$759K. Mo Goodfellow (Director, Marketing & Digital) is leading the evaluation after his senior e-commerce manager (Diamante) went on personal leave, and he needs to present a costed replatforming proposal to the board in mid-February, with budgets signed off by end of June for a new financial year starting August 1.",
      "why_change": "C.P. Hart's current e-commerce platform is a custom-built, legacy system described as 'quite custom made, quite old' and 'split in two,' where every small change requires going through a dev agency with no clarity on timelines. The website is the primary lead generation engine for their showroom business (90-95% of sales), yet the current platform fails to represent their luxury brand adequately online and lacks best-practice UI/UX, templated design capabilities, and proper customer journey tracking. Mo emphasized the existential business case: 'we're 90 years old next year. If we want to last for another 90 years we need to start at the beginning of the funnel again.' Significant organizational change — their MD was promoted out and the parent company has a new CEO — adds pressure to demonstrate digital modernization.",
      "why_shopify": "C.P. Hart is drawn to Shopify Plus for its templated best practices, built-in UI/UX capabilities, and the ability to represent their luxury brand beautifully without requiring an in-house expert designer. Shopify's integrated approach to online and in-store operations appeals to their hybrid business model (50% end consumer, 50% trade/contracts), and the platform's flexibility, faster development cycles, and clear timelines stand in direct contrast to their current agency dependency. Shopify Payments at potentially advantageous rates was noted as a factor. No other competitors were explicitly mentioned, suggesting Shopify may be the primary alternative being evaluated.",
      "why_now": "The primary urgency driver is a board meeting in mid-February where Mo must present a costed replatforming proposal. Budgets for the new financial year (starting August 1) are signed off by end of June — if not approved this cycle, the project slips an entire year. Additional urgency from organizational shake-up (MD promoted out, new parent company CEO) creates both risk and opportunity. Diamante's unexpected personal leave has compressed the evaluation timeline.",
      "support_needed": "Business case / TCO calculation for board presentation; case studies of similar luxury retailers on Shopify Plus; agency recommendations for implementation partner; NDA in Word format (process prerequisite); payments clarity around third-party fee implications; extra technical hand-holding while Diamante is on leave; timeline confidence for August launch."
