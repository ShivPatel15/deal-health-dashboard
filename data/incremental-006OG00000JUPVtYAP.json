A 30-min business case call with Eleanor (FD) and Tom (CTO) took place on Feb 20 but full transcript was not captured, so outcome of rate/cost discussion is unknown. Follow-up needed to confirm: (1) whether rate concerns were addressed or narrowed, (2) whether board-ready TCO materials were reviewed, (3) next steps Eleanor/board need. Additional support still needed: Irish entity guidance (Ben Homer international docs), Arttov architecture clarity, implementation timeline to hit Christmas 2026 go-live."
